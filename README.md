## Business Case

Olist is a Brazilian e-commerce platform that facilitates connections between small and medium-sized businesses and customers across Brazil. As a marketplace, merchants can list their products and services, while customers can browse and make purchases online.

The dataset contains comprehensive information on each order, including order dates, product details, payment and shipping information, customer and seller IDs, and customer reviews. Additionally, it provides data on sellers listing their products on Olist, as well as customer behavior and demographics. The primary objective of this analysis is to help Olist gain valuable insights into their e-commerce platform, identify opportunities for growth, and optimize their operations.
